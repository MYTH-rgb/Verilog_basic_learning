# Verilog_basic_learning
Verilog self - learning journey

Starting from the purpose that all verilog projects from the basic ones, such as Multiple_bits_Adder, D_Flip_Flop,..., to the more advanced,specified ones, FIFO for example, should be recorded through this channel, so that I can track my progress.

Each of my projects consists of two files, the design file and the testbench file.
